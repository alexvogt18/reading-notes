# Reading Assignment 8
## Operators and Loops

### 1) Comparison operators evaluates data
- Evaluating data returns a Boolean: true or false.

   - == : equal to while ===: strict equal to
   - != : not equal to while !== : strict not equal to.

### 2) Logical operators evaluates the logic of data

- &&: Logical and. This means that both statements must be true to be a true statement.

- ||: Logical or. This means that if either statement is true, the statement is true.

- !: Logical not. This terms causes the term to evaluate the opposite of what it solves as.

### 3) Loops

- If the condition of a block is true, then it will run. The loop is then tried again, if the loop returns true, than the block will run again.

    - For

        - If a loop needs to be run a specific amount of times. The counter is the amount of times it needs to run.

    - While and Do While

        - While will run the block as many times as true. Do while will run the block at least once, even if the statement is false.

## Example: 

- for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    document.write(i);
}
