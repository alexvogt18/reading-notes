## This is my first public repository for my reading notes in class 102 of CodeFellows!
### **This section will be discussing the concept of "Self-Growth" according to me!**
#### Self growth can only occur if one's personal mindset is focusing on the end of the journey instead of the hardships of the present.
#### If one is able to use all of his or her experiences whether they be positive or negative in a way to better oneself, than self growth will occur!
#### *Conversly, if one is unable to use these experiences to better oneself, self growth will not be able to occur*
