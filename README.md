### **This section will be discussing the concept of "Self-Growth" according to me!**
### Self growth
self growth
: can only occur if one's personal mindset is focusing on the end of the journey instead of the hardships of the present.
#### If one is able to use all of his/her/their experiences whether they be positive or negative in a way to better oneself, than self growth will occur!
#### *Conversly, if one is unable to use these experiences to better oneself, self growth will not be able to occur*
### So how can someone remind themselves to have this mindset? **Here are 3 ways:**
1. Patience is key
-     Understand that new skills need time to develop so that one can be effective when employing these skills
2. Give 100% effort
-     If one were to rely on someone else to explain concepts to he/she/they, then the real learning concepts cannot be embedded in one's knowledge toolbox.
3. Go into each day eager for more learning opportunities.
