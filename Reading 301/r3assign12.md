## Mongo and Mongoose

#### List 5 differences between SQL and NoSQL
- SQL are called as Relational Databases or RDBMS, while nonSQL are called as non-relational databases.
- SQL has predefined schema while nonSQL has dynamic schema
- SQL is vertically scalable wheras the noSQL databases are horizontally scalable.
- SQL is structural query language for difining and manipulating the data while noSQL unstructured.
- SQL emphasizes on ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability)

- #### What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
    - Large no of write operations in a high traffic website.

- #### Give a real world example
    - Spotify

- #### What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
    - If data must be stored in JSON like documents.

- #### Give a real world example.
    - MTV

- #### Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
    - SQL

- #### Which type of database is best for scalability?
    - NoSQL such as Mongo.

- #### What does SQL stand for?
    - Structured Query Language.

- #### What is a relational database?
    - database that stores datapoints that is related to other data.

- #### What type of structure does a relational database work with?

- #### What is a schema?
    - Collection of logical structures of data or schema objects.

- #### What is a NoSQL database?
    - It's a database that is more dynamic than the rigid SQL language.

- #### How does it work?
    - Structures must be defined prior to implementing data, unlike SQL which is a rigid structure.

- #### What is inside of a Mongo database?
    - data records that are stored as documents inside a JSON.

- #### Which is more flexible - SQL or Mongo DB? and why.
    - Mongo DB, it is nosql and scalable while SQL is not.

- #### What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
    - Not as rigid and therefore takes longer to build the structure.
