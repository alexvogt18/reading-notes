## Authentication

- #### What is OAuth?
    - an "open-standard" authorization that allows unrelated servers to interact with one another without sharing credentials.

- #### Give an example of what using OAuth would look like.
    - In order to log onto a website, you might be redirected to another site to input credentials that would allow access to the first site.


- #### How does OAuth work? What are the steps that it takes to authenticate the user?
    - The second site produces a single one time token that is used to authorize the user.

- #### What is Open ID?
    - Open ID is similar, however it referes to authorization by a second party site.

- #### What is the difference between authorization and authentication?
    - Authentication is for machines using other machines that need permission to access a server.

    - Useful for when only an ID code is needed for authorization.

- #### What is Client Credentials Flow?
    - Authorizing the app instead of the user, like between a machine and machine interaction.
