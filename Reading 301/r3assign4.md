# Reading Assignment 4
## React and Forms

- #### What is a Controlled Component?
    - An input that is controlled by React.

- ##### Should we wait to store user's responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update as soon as they enter into the form?
    - handleChange updates with every keystroke, but I think that the form should only update after a submission is made due to mistakes that might be made by the user.

- #### How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?
    - textarea uses a value attribute instead of the event handler being on the input field.

- #### Why would we use a ternary operator?
    - It's a shorter version of using an if/else statement.

- #### Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:
x === y ? 'true' : 'false';
