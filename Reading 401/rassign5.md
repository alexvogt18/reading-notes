## Linked Lists

#### - One of the most distinct feature of a linked list is how each node within the list references the node before and/or after it.

#### - A Singly and Doubly node determine what node the current node references.

#### - Linked Lists are different from arrays due to not being able to use a for or foreach operation to access the data. Instead, Linked Lists use the Next property to access the next item in the linked list.

#### - Linked Lists take up more random spaces of bytes while arrays take up more ordered blocks of bytes.

#### - In terms of Big 0 notation, linked lists consume less processing than items in a linear array.
