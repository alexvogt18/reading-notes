## Debugging

#### JavaScript Chapter 10: *Error Handling & Debugging*

-  Debugging involves first finding the error by deduction, the console narrowing the area down to where the error is located so that one may find it.

- Every error object has the same properties
    - Name: Type of Error
    - message: Description
    - fileNumber: Name of the JavaScript file
    - lineNumber: Line number of error

- JavaScript has 7 different errors
    - Error: Generic error
    -SyntaxError: proper syntax or form has not been made.
    - ReferenceError: Tried to use a variable that isn't declared
    - TypeError: Un recognized data type 
    - RangeError: Number used outside proper range
    - URIError: encode and decode not used correctly.
    - EvalError: eval() function used incorrectly

- try, catch, finally statements are used to gracefully handle errors.
