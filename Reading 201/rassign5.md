#### Blog Post: *JPEG vs PNG vs GIF*

- TL;DR section from the [blog post:](https://blog.imagekit.io/jpeg-vs-png-vs-gif-which-image-format-to-use-and-when-c8913ae3e01d) "Use JPEG format for all images that contain a natural scene or photograph where variation in colour and intensity is smooth. Use PNG format for any image that needs transparency or for images with text & objects with sharp contrast edges like logos. Use GIF format for images that contain animations."

- JPEG images do not support transparency while PNG and GIF images are able to declare single colors in a color pallete as transparent.

- Only GIFs are able to support animations.
